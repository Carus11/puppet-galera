This is a good start to play around with the galera multi-master mysql synchronous replication (http://www.codership.com/products/mysql_galera)

HOWTO:

 * install vagrant: http://vagrantup.com/
 * get debian squeeze basebox (http://vagrantbox.es) or build your own (https://github.com/jedi4ever/veewee)
 * type "vagrant up"
 * watch 3 nodes to get provisioned
 * play around (add a database and data, chaos-monkey nodes etc.)


WARNING

Change the mysql root password in production and limit access to galera cluster members!

TODO

 * naming: master -> donor
 * put a load balancer in front of the cluster
 * make cluster "masterless"
